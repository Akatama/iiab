6-generic-apps README
=====================

This 6th stage is for apps of a more generic or collaborative nature, as opposed to educational or managerial apps in later stages.

Chat, Wiki and CMS's (Content Management Systems) can go here.

As in the case of 7-edu-apps, 8-mgmt-tools and 9-local-addons: this stage installs user-facing server apps.
