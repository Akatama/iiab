### JupyterHub programming environment with student Notebooks

* Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in the scientific community.
* This IIAB package permits individual users to start using their own notebook on the server, without needing an individual server account.
* Once a user signs in with a user name, and password, these credentials are stored, and are used thereafter to gain access to the user's files.
* Individual folders are created for all student work in the path /var/lib/protected/.  Individual students will only be able to see their own work in that directory.
* Students will not have any privileges outside of their own folder.
* They may upload Jupyter Notebooks from a local machine, and download the current state of their work via a normal browser download.
