# Nextcloud

This Ansible playbook was derived from an earlier ownCloud playbook thanks to [Josh Dennis](https://github.com/floydianslips) in 2016/2017.

Login to Nextcloud at http://box/nextcloud, http://box.lan/nextcloud, http://172.18.96.1/nextcloud (or similar) using:

    Username: Admin
    Password: changeme
