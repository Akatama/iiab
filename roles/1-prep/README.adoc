== 1-prep README

This 1st
https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Contributors-Guide#ansible[stage]
(1-prep) arranges low-level things like remote support infra, DNS prep,
hardware, low-level OS quirks, and basic security:

* SSHD
* OpenVPN if/as needed later for remote support
* https://github.com/iiab/iiab/tree/master/roles/iiab-admin#iiab-admin-readme[iiab-admin]
username and group, to log into Admin Console
* dnsmasq (install now, configure later!)
* Universally unique identifier: /etc/iiab/uuid
* Ubermix (distro) needs /etc/tmpfiles.d/iiab.conf to create essential
/var/log subdirs on each boot
* *_Hardware actions:_*
  ** Install https://github.com/iiab/iiab/blob/master/roles/1-prep/templates/iiab-expand-rootfs[iiab-expand-rootfs]
  ** link:tasks/raspberry_pi.yml[*_raspberry_pi.yml_*]:
    *** RTC (real-time clock): install udev rule, configure, enable
    *** *_Install packages related to:_*
      **** growpart
      **** swapfile
      **** fake-hwclock (as RTC is often missing or dead!)
      **** Wi-Fi
    *** Increase swap file size
  ** NUC 6 Wi-Fi firmware

Recap: Similar to 0-init, 2-common, 3-base-server, 4 server-options and
5-xo-services â€” this 1st stage installs core server infra (that is not
user-facing).
