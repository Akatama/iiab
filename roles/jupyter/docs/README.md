### Jupyter Notebooks on Rpi Server
* Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in the scientific community.
* This IIAB package permits individal users to start using their own notebook on the server without needing an individual server account.
* Once a user signs in with a user name, and password, these credentials are stored, and are used thereafter to gain access to the user's files.
* Individual folders are created for all student work in the path /var/lib/protected/. Individual students will only be able to see their own work in that directory.
* Students will not have any priviletes outside of their own folder.
