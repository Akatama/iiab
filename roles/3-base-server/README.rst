====================
3-base-server README
====================

This 3rd stage installs base server infra required by all, such as: the web server, administrator
security (iiab-admin by default) and MySQL (the database underlying many/most user-facing apps).

4-server-options follows with more optional/diverse server infra functionality.

As in the case of 2-common, 4-server-options and 5-xo-services: this stage installs core server infra, that is not user-facing.
