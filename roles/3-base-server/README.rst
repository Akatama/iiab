====================
3-base-server README
====================

This 3rd stage installs base server infra that Internet-in-a-Box requires, including:

- the web server
- administrator security (username iiab-admin by default)
- MySQL (the database underlying many/most user-facing apps)

4-server-options follows with more diverse/optional server infra functionality.

As in the case of 2-common, 4-server-options and 5-xo-services: this stage installs core server infra, that is not user-facing.
