=======================
4-server-options README
=======================

Whereas the roles/tasks in 3-base-server are required, this 4th stage includes more optional roles/tasks for core server infra.

It includes some networking fundamentals, before they're configured later on.

As in the case of 2-common, 3-base-server and 5-xo-services: this stage installs core server infra, that is not user-facing.
