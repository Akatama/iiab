This role provides two services, pan or Personal Area Network, and term, terminal emulation.

They may be turned on or off with iiab-bt-pan-on(off) and iiab-bt-term-on(off), respectively.

The terminal emulates a vt100 and operates at 115200 bps, but does not always connect reliably.

This role is only available for the Raspberry Pi.
