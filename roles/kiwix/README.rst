Kiwix develops ZIM file creation & rendering tools for offline action,
as summarized at: http://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Software

We are using the kiwix-serve and kiwix-manage executables to setup and
render Wikipedia and other web sources in ZIM format.

Locations
---------

- Your ZIM files are expected to be in /library/zims/content
- Your ZIM index files are expected to be in directories under /library/zims/index
- The URL is http://box:3000

Your local ZIM catalog (at /library/zims/library.xml) can be
regenerated by running: iiab-make-kiwix-lib
