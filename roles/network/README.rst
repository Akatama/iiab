Network README
==============

This is run by Ansible after it has installed the core of Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) and its apps/services.

Specifically, this 'network' stage is run:

- automatically during IIAB installation, after /opt/iiab/iiab/iiab-install has run `Stages 0-to-9 <..>`_ (thanks to `iiab-stages.yml <../../iiab-stages.yml>`_)
- automatically by IIAB's Admin Console (http://box/admin) if you click ``Configure`` menu -> ``Install Configured Options`` â€” this is similar to the above, but only runs Stage 0, then Stage 4-to-9, and then finally this 'network' stage (thanks to `iiab-from-console.yml <../../iiab-from-console.yml>`_)
- or manually, if you run ``cd /opt/iiab/iiab`` then `./iiab-network <../../iiab-network>`_ (which is much the same as running ``./runrole network``)
