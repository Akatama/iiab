*Sharing the World’s Free Knowledge*

Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)
========================

`Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) <http://internet-in-a-box.org>`__ is a
“learning hotspot” that brings the Internet’s crown jewels (Wikipedia in
any language, thousands of Khan Academy videos, zoomable OpenStreetMap,
electronic books, WordPress journaling, Toys from Trash electronics
projects, ETC) to those without Internet.

You can build your own tiny, affordable server (an offline digital
library) for your school, your medical clinic, your prison, your region
and/or your very own family — accessible with any nearby smartphone,
tablet or laptop.

Internet-in-a-Box gives you the DIY tools to: 1. Download then
drag-and-drop to arrange the `very best of the World’s Free
Knowledge <http://internet-in-a-box.org/#quality-content>`__. 2. Choose
among `30 powerful educational
apps <http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_services_.28IIAB_apps.29_are_suggested_during_installation.3F>`__
for your school or learning/teaching community, optionally with a
complete LMS (learning management system). 3. Exchange local/indigenous
knowledge with nearby communities, using our `Manage
Content <https://github.com/iiab/iiab-admin-console/blob/master/roles/console/files/help/InstContent.rst#manage-content>`__
interface and possible mesh networking.

FYI this `community
product <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet-in-a-Box>`__ is enabled
by professional volunteers working
`side-by-side <http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#What_are_the_best_places_for_community_support.3F>`__
with schools, clinics and libraries around the world. *Thank you for

Installation
------------

Install Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) from
`download.iiab.io <http://download.iiab.io/>`__

Please see `FAQ.IIAB.IO <http://FAQ.IIAB.IO>`__ which has 40+ questions
and answers to help you along the way, as you put together the “local
learning hotspot” most suitable for your own teaching/learning
community.

Our `HOW-TO
videos <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cBGCxr_WPBPa3IqPVEe3g>`__ can
be very helpful and the
`Installation <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation>`__
wiki page has more intricate details e.g. if you’re trying to install
Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) onto a `different
Linux <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Platforms>`__ that has not
yet been tried.

After you’ve installed the software, you should `add
content <https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation#add-content>`__,
which can of course take time when downloading multi-gigabyte Content
Packs!

Finally, you can `customize your Internet-in-a-Box home
page <http://wiki.laptop.org/go/IIAB/FAQ#How_do_I_customize_my_Internet-in-a-Box_home_page.3F>`__
(typically http://box or http://box.lan) using our **drag-and-drop**
Admin Console (http://box.lan/admin) — to arrange Content Packs and IIAB
Apps (services) for your local community’s needs.
