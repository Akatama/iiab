# Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)

Welcome to the Git repository for Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB).  This community-based project is enabled by professional volunteers around the world.  Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) is a small, inexpensive device which provides essential Internet resources (Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, Khan Academy and others) without any Internet connection.

You are encouraged to customize this local content hotspot or server with the best of the world’s Free Knowledge — to suit your region, your school, your medical clinic, your library — and/or for your very own family.

## Installation

Pre-releases of Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) are available from http://download.iiab.io — click on the highest version number and then launch the 1-line installer.

Please see "What are the best places for community support?" at http://FAQ.IIAB.IO which has 40+ questions and answers to help you along the way, as you put together the digital knowledge hotspot most suitable for your own community.

The [Installation](https://github.com/iiab/iiab/wiki/IIAB-Installation) wiki page has more intricate details e.g. if you're trying to install Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) on a different Linux distribution that has not yet been tried.

#### Built with Ansible

FYI we use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) as the underlying technology to install, deploy, configure and manage the various software components.

## Contributing

We greatly welcome contributions from educators, librarians *and* IT/UX/QA people of all kinds!
