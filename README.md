# Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB)

Welcome to the Git repository for Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB).  Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB) is a small, inexpensive device which provides essential Internet resources (Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, Khan Academy and others) without any Internet connection.

You are encouraged to customize this local content hotspot or server with the best of the world’s Free Knowledge — to suit your own region, your school, your medical clinic, your library and/or for your very own family.

FYI this community product is enabled by professional volunteers working side-by-side with schools, clinics and libraries around the world.  Thank you for being a part of our grassroots technology movement!
